# BEGIN FABLE-ENGINEER HELD BINDING INTERMEDIATES (E-36, 2026-09-23): binding an exact frame slices the arena and reshapes the slice;
# the slice, and the level arrays whose unstacked parts are all the frame keeps (scratch, destination, previous level), are then
# discarded, and the client frees each discarded handle in its own round trip. On a cold net that is ~2.5k extra round trips on the
# MLP that sets both the worst wall and the worst residual (engineer2's census). Here the arena slices and the bound views are held
# in _BH_HOLD until the current kernel call ends, so they are freed together with the call's other held aliases. Same ops, same
# arguments, same bill; only handle lifetimes change.
