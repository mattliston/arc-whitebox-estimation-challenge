# BEGIN FABLE-ENGINEER2 --s1zero (E2-S1Z, 2026-09-24; an APPROXIMATION, gated on VALID40): the star's s1 term (pw w) is dropped:
# sub = s2 / 3 (the float32 value of (2 * 0 + s2) / 3); no range finder for pw; C w stays the single depth-6 product. In-process
# parity vs S21s1 (#332236) on 35/100/37/39: bill -2.479%, MSE -0.489% (per net -0.51/-1.25/+0.29/-0.54), adjusted -2.956%.
