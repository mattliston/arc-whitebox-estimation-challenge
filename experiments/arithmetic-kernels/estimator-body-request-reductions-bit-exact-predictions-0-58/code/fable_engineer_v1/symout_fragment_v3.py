# BEGIN FABLE-ENGINEER SYMMETRIC-OUTPUT COVARIANCE (E-43 v3, 2026-09-23; rounding-level, not bit-exact): the covariance push
# w^T (C w) of every layer is symmetric, so only its upper blocks are computed: the top half-rows [G11 G12] as one 512x1024x1024 _mm
# and G22 as one 512x1024x512 _mm, with G21 = G12^T mirrored (0.428 instead of 0.551 dense units). The layer's two star products stay
# batched (P=2). Plain _mm products and copies only: no einsum, no SymmetricTensor, nothing for flopscope to infer or validate as
# symmetric. v1/v2 also had a weighted-Gram einsum (old-tier joined core) and a layer-0 Gram einsum; an f32 einsum whose output
# flopscope infers symmetric is validated with allclose(R, R.T, atol=1e-6) and raised SymmetryError on a net, so both are gone.
