# BEGIN FABLE-ENGINEER CHEAPER FRAME BINDING (E-38, 2026-09-23): flopscope bills reshape at numel even for views, and binding is
# 5.3% of a cold net's bill (2.1% of a warm one). Two bindings are pure waste:
#  (a) _cp3_bind_arena_views reshaped every region of every layout (0.9% of a cold net) although no live code ever reads those
#      region views: the kernel only needs the tuple's identity and _VIEW_SPECS (arena, specs). The tuple now holds plain markers.
#  (b) the read5 child frames were bound twice per read shape, for packets of 2 and of 3 level-4 slots. They are now bound once
#      (3 slots) with the packet axis leading, and the 2-slot packets use the free leading slice [:2] of the same arrays.
# Same ops on the same values; only scratch addresses and view bookkeeping change: bit-exact. Saves the arena binding on every
# (re)started worker and 2/5 of the read5 child binding on every net.
